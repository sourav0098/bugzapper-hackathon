# Passkey Authentication React App with End-to-End Encryption
Welcome to the Passkey Authentication React App with End-to-End Encryption! This application showcases the implementation of passkey authentication in a React-based web application using the Hanko API.

## Project Description
In an era where data security and user privacy are of utmost importance, traditional authentication methods like passwords have become vulnerable to various cyber threats. This project introduces a more robust and secure alternative â€“ passkey authentication.

### What is a Passkey?

A passkey is a cryptographic key or authentication method that offers users a secure and convenient way to access their accounts and sensitive data. Unlike traditional passwords, passkeys are resistant to common attacks such as phishing and credential stuffing. They are securely stored and challenging to compromise, making them a crucial element in modern data security and privacy.
